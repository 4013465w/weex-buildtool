# Weex Transformer

It transforms `Weex DSL` code into `JavaScript bundle`, which can be executed by `JavaScript framework`.

This repository contains four sub repositories. `Transformer` is the main node module, which depends on `template transformer`, `style transformer` and `script transformer` to parse the content of `<template>`, `<style>` and `<script>` concretely.
